STGen is a generator of simple and proper temporal graphs.

The official implementation of STGen is in C++, it is available in the ```cpp``` directory. It is presented in detail on the official [STGen page](https://arnaudcasteigts.net/blog/stgen.html).

In this repository, you can also find older versions in Julia (outdated and potentially buggy) and in Rust (slightly outdated, but working fine).
